### Important Note

Some Microsoft Windows 10 users experienced (various) problems when they tried to synchronise
with GitHub. As an alternative they can use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
It might be enough to just to do the initial "synchronise" with GitHub Desktop and
then revert to using RStudio.

## Re-creating the Workshop Materials.

Run the [_make.R](https://github.com/saghirb/Getting-Started-with-Git-and-GitHub-for-R-Users/blob/master/_make.R)
